"""cdxml-toolkit: Python toolkit for ChemDraw CDXML reaction scheme processing.

Provides tools for reading, writing, manipulating, and rendering ChemDraw CDXML
files. Includes reaction scheme layout, reagent classification, structure
alignment, and a declarative DSL for building schemes from YAML or text.

Core utilities are available without optional dependencies. RDKit, ChemDraw COM,
and other heavy dependencies are lazy-imported and only required when their
specific features are used.
